0.013     2015-07-21 01:55:31Z
          - use quotemeta() in regular expressions, to avoid choking when a
            contributor name contains special characters

0.012     2015-07-06 23:35:19Z
          - log a warning if user configs are missing

0.011     2015-03-21 18:10:36Z
          - new "remove" option, to specify patterns to match for exclusion

0.010     2015-02-14 22:01:43Z
          - match authors against committers using email address, rather than
            using a full exact string match

0.009     2015-01-19 18:42:40Z
          - avoid fatal error when there are no git commits

0.008     2014-10-22 03:30:59Z
          - fix test that broke with changes in Dist::Zilla::Tester 5.021 (it
            was my own patch, even!)

0.007     2014-08-16 06:31:41Z
          - added the new "path" configuration option, for help in building
            dists contained within a subdirectory of a repository

0.006     2014-08-15 01:44:00Z
          - increase the minimum required version of Unicode::Collate
          - increase the minimum required version of Git::Wrapper
          - avoid doubly-encoded committer strings on older perls by avoiding
            encoding the string before we send it to IPC::Open3
          - make sure not to crash doing "dzil build" when a user has no
            user.name and include_releaser = 0 (Kent Fredric, #1)

0.005     2014-08-13 00:46:11Z
          - basic tests are now ascii-only; unicode tests are marked as TODO
            on MSWin32 for now (see (github) genehack/Git-Wrapper#52 for the
            gory details)
          - now properly sorting names using case-insensitive unicode collation

0.004     2014-08-08 01:29:08Z
          - when on MSWin32, check for mysysgit version and also set
            appropriate config options for proper unicode support
          - new "order_by" configuration option, to allow sorting contributors
            by number of commits made, rather than alphabetically
          - mark "include_releaser" option as experimental, as it will likely
            get removed if CPAN-API/metacpan-web#1270 gets resolved

0.003     2014-08-07 02:32:19Z
          - new 'include_releaser' option, for filtering the releaser user out
            of the contributor list after 'include_authors' has been applied
            (include_authors = 1, include_releaser = 0 recommended)

0.002     2014-08-06 05:21:51Z
          - do not add an empty x_contributors key if there are no
            (non-author) contributors to report
          - fix test failures when run on a system where git has not been
            configured
          - warn at runtime if Pod::Weaver::Section::Contributors is too old
            to pull data from distmeta on its own
          - do not blow up if run in a directory that is not tracked by git

0.001     2014-07-31 01:42:08Z
          - Initial release.
