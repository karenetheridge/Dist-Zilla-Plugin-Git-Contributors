          - make sure not to crash doing "dzil build" when a user has no
            user.name and include_releaser = 0 (Kent Fredric, #1)

          - basic tests are now ascii-only; unicode tests are marked as TODO
            on MSWin32 for now (see (github) genehack/Git-Wrapper#52 for the
            gory details)
          - now properly sorting names using case-insensitive unicode collation

          - when on MSWin32, check for mysysgit version and also set
            appropriate config options for proper unicode support
          - new "order_by" configuration option, to allow sorting contributors
            by number of commits made, rather than alphabetically
          - mark "include_releaser" option as experimental, as it will likely
            get removed if CPAN-API/metacpan-web#1270 gets resolved

          - new 'include_releaser' option, for filtering the releaser user out
            of the contributor list after 'include_authors' has been applied
            (include_authors = 1, include_releaser = 0 recommended)

          - do not add an empty x_contributors key if there are no
            (non-author) contributors to report
          - fix test failures when run on a system where git has not been
            configured
          - warn at runtime if Pod::Weaver::Section::Contributors is too old
            to pull data from distmeta on its own
          - do not blow up if run in a directory that is not tracked by git

0.001     2014-07-31 01:42:08Z
          - Initial release.
